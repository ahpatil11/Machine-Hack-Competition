👋 Welcome to our Hackathon on tackling air pollution! 🌬️ Air pollution is a major global issue that affects the health and well-being of millions of people. 💔 To help you understand the quality of air in your city, we've included some important keywords for you to explore. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a widely-used measure of air pollution that provides information on the quality of air in a city on a daily basis. 🔍 You can check the AQI of your location or search for the AQI by city, and even view it on a live map.

🤔 If you're wondering why the air quality is unhealthy today, the AQI calculation takes into account the levels of five major air pollutants, including ground-level ozone, particle pollution/particulate matter (PM2.5/pm 10), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. These pollutants can have different impacts on health, and their levels are measured to determine the overall AQI. In the United States, you can also find a ranking of air quality by state.

🌡️ The AQI is divided into six levels of air quality, ranging from "good" to "hazardous". It's important to pay attention to the AQI in your area and take precautions if the air quality is poor. With this knowledge, we hope you can take steps to protect yourself and those around you from the harmful effects of air pollution.

👉 The AQI bucket categories are outlined below:

0 - Good (0-50) - This indicates minimal impact.
1 - Satisfactory (51-100) - This category can cause minor breathing difficulties in susceptible individuals.
2 - Moderately polluted (101-200) - This category can cause breathing difficulties in people with lung diseases, such as asthma, as well as discomfort for heart disease patients, children, and older adults.
3 - Poor (201-300) - This category can cause breathing difficulties in people who are exposed to it for prolonged periods, as well as discomfort for individuals with heart disease.
4 - Very Poor (301-400) - This category can cause respiratory illness in people who are exposed to it for prolonged periods.
5 - Severe (401-500) - This category can cause respiratory issues in otherwise healthy people, and may result in very severe health problems for those with lung or heart disease.
6 - Very Severe (500 and above) - This category is considered uninhabitable.
🌍 Our hackathon is focused on finding innovative solutions to reduce air pollution and improve air quality. 🙌 We encourage participants to use their creativity and expertise to develop solutions that can help mitigate the negative impacts of air pollution on health and the environment. Let's work together to create a healthier, cleaner future for everyone! 🌿💪
